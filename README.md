# isala-code
This is the code I've written for my graduation project "Piep Piep Paniek" for the hospital Isala in Zwolle. This code is from my game-project made using Unity, however I do not want to share all of the project files. This is purely meant to have a look at the code. 

The NEW_Scripts folder contains the code that is used in the project, while OLD_Scripts is redundant code. I've kept the OLD_Scripts available to see, as they were part of the progress.

Enjoy ^^
